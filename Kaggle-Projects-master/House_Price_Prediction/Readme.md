#### 1] Data Analysis (To find out Outliers, Null Values)
#### 2] Data Cleaning (Addressed the problem found in step 1)
#### 3] Data Visualization (Scatter plots, Histograms, Correlation Matrix, Data distribution)
#### 4] Data Munging (encoding of zip code, Logarithmic transformations)
#### 6] Feature Selection (Recursive feature elimination)
#### 7] Machine Learning Models (Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Polynomial regression)
